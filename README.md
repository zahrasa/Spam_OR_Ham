# Spam_or_Ham Emails
NLP

In this repository, an issue related to NLP was addressed again. This was a binary classification of spam or ham PERSIAN emails. In this case, tokenization, normalization, and stemming due to the language of the emails were applied by Parsivar Libraries.

The emails were then vectorized by TFIDF method. The Random forest classifier was used to train the model.
